# Weighted directed graphs (directed networks)

> Made by Nerya Bigon.  

## Goal:
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement two key interfaces:
* Weighted directed graph interface.
* Weighted directed graphs algorithms interface.  

In addition we'll create a graphical inteface that allows you to load graphs from files, save them, edit them and run algorithms on them.
